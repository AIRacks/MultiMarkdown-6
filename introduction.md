## What is Markdown ##

To understand what MultiMarkdown is, you first should be familiar with
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/ "Daring Fireball:
Markdown"). The best description of what Markdown is comes from John Gruber's
Markdown web site:

> Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown
> allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text
> format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).

> Thus, "Markdown" is two things: (1) a plain text formatting
> syntax; and (2) a software tool, written in Perl, that converts
> the plain text formatting to HTML. See the Syntax page for details
> pertaining to Markdown's formatting syntax. You can try it out,
> right now, using the online Dingus.

> The overriding design goal for Markdown's formatting syntax is to
> make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted
> document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking
> like it's been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While
> Markdown's syntax has been influenced by several existing
> text-to-HTML filters, the single biggest source of inspiration for
> Markdown's syntax is the format of plain text email. --- [John Gruber]
