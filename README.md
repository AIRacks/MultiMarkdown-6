## An Announcement! ##

I would like to officially announce that MultiMarkdown version 6 is in public
alpha.  It's finally at a point where it is usable, but there are quite a few
caveats.

This post is a way for me to organize some of my thoughts, provide some
history for those who are interested, and to provide some tips and tricks from
my experiences for those who are working on their own products.

But first, some background...



## Differences in MultiMarkdown Itself ##

MultiMarkdown v6 is mostly about making a better MMD parser, but it will
likely involve a few changes to the MultiMarkdown language itself.


1. {--I am thinking about removing Setext headers from the language.  I almost
never use them, much preferring to use ATX style headers (`# foo #`).
Additionally, I have never liked the fact that Setext headers allow the
meaning of a line to be completely changed by the following line.  It makes
the parsing slightly more difficult on a technical level (requiring some
backtracking at times).  I'm not 100% certain on this, but right now I believe
it's the only Markdown feature that doesn't exist in MMD 6 yet.--}{++I decided
to go ahead and implement Setext headers, as it can be done with the new
parser without backtracking.  One difference with older versions of MMD, as
well as Markdown itself, is that a setext header can consist of more than one
line to be included in the header.++}

2. Whitespace is not allowed between the text brackets and label brackets in
reference links, images, footnotes, etc.  For example `[foo] [bar]` will no
longer be the same as `[foo][bar]`.

3. Link and image titles can be quoted with `'foo'`, `"foo"`, or `(foo)`.

4. HTML elements are handled slightly differently.  There is no longer a
`markdown="1"` feature.  Instead, HTML elements that are on a line by
themselves will open an HTML block that will cause the rest of the "paragraph"
to be treated as HTML such that Markdown will not be parsed in side of it.
HTML block-level tags are even "stronger" at starting an HTML block.  It is
not quite as complex as the approach used in CommonMark, but is similar under
most circumstances.

	For example, this would not be parsed:

		<div>
		*foo*
		</div>

	But this would be:

		<div>

		*foo*

		</div>

5. "Malformed" reference link definitions are handled slightly differently.
For example, `Reference Footnotes.text` is parsed differently in compatibility
mode than MMD-5.  This started as a side-effect of the parsing algorithm, but
I actually think it makes sense.  This may or may not change in the future.

6. Table captions in MMD-6 must come immediately *after* the table, not
before it.

7. Escaped linebreaks (`\` preceding a line break) will be interpreted as
`<br />` (even in compatibility mode).  This was previously an optional
feature in MMD, but I don't see a problem with just making it default 
behavior.


## Where Does MultiMarkdown 6 Stand? ##


### Features ###

I *think* that all basic Markdown features have been implemented.
Additionally, the following MultiMarkdown features have been implemented:

* Automatic cross-reference targets
* Basic Citation support
* CriticMarkup support
* Definition lists
* Figures
* Footnotes
* Inline and reference footnotes
* Image and Link attributes (attributes can now be used with inline links as
	well as reference links)
* Math support
* Smart quotes (support for languages other than english is not fully
	implemented yet)
* Superscripts/subscripts
* Table of Contents
* Tables


Things that are partially completed:

* Citations -- still need:
	* Syntax for "not cited" entries
	* Output format
	* HTML --> separate footnotes and citations?
	* Locators required?
* CriticMarkup -- need to decide:
	* How to handle CM stretches that include blank lines
* Fenced code blocks
* Headers -- need support for manual labels
* Metadata
* Full/Snippet modes


Things yet to be completed:

* Abbreviations
* Glossaries
* File Transclusion


### Accuracy ###

MultiMarkdown v6 successfully parses the Markdown [syntax page], except for
the Setext header at the top.  It passes the 29 test files currently in place.
